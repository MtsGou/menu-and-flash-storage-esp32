Menu and EEPROM handling application for ESP32 Microcontroller. Manipulate float, integer, small integer, string and integer array data in EEPROM memory for ESP32 series. This application offers a visual menu to the user, enabling the editing of variables of types float, integer, small integer, string and integer array through UART, allowing also to save parameters on EEPROM and recover data saved. When MCU starts, it looks on EEPROM memory for stored data, and inits the parameters with values as saved previously by the user. This can be an aditional feature for a device. Variables are converted to char and saved in EEPROM as string with comma divider, using also CRC error detection method for confiability check of saved data in EEPROM.
